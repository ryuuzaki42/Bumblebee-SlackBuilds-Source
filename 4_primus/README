Primus is a shared library that provides OpenGL and GLX APIs and
implements low-overhead local-only client-side OpenGL offloading via
GLX forking, similar to VirtualGL. It intercepts GLX calls and
redirects GL rendering to a secondary X display, presumably driven
by a faster GPU.

This SlackBuild can build and package 32-bit compatible binaries and
libraries for x86_64 systems. To enable this, pass the variable COMPAT32:

  # COMPAT32=yes ./primus.SlackBuild
