# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

primus: primus (OpenGL offloading)
primus:
primus: Primus is a shared library that provides OpenGL and GLX APIs and
primus: implements low-overhead local-only client-side OpenGL offloading via
primus: GLX forking, similar to VirtualGL. It intercepts GLX calls and
primus: redirects GL rendering to a secondary X display, presumably driven
primus: by a faster GPU.
