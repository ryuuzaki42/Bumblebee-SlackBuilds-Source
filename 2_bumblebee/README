Bumblebee daemon is a rewrite of the original Bumblebee service,
providing an elegant and stable means of managing Optimus hybrid
graphics chipsets.  A primary goal of this project is to not only
enable use of the discrete GPU for rendering, but also to enable
smart power management of the dGPU when it's not in use.

Bumblebee requires either primus or VirtualGL at runtime. Primus is
recommended as it is lightweight and provides far better performance.
However, at the time of writings this, primus is still a work in
progress, and some things may not work correctly.

You will need a usergroup called "bumblebee" for the bumblebee daemon:
  # groupadd bumblebee

Then add any users that should have optimus access to the group:
  # usermod -G bumblebee -a USERNAME
