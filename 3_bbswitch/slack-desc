# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

bbswitch: bbswitch (ACPI kernel module for NVIDIA Optimus)
bbswitch:
bbswitch: bbswitch is a kernel module which automatically detects the required
bbswitch: ACPI calls for two kinds of Optimus laptops. It has been verified to
bbswitch: work with "real" Optimus and "legacy" Optimus laptops (at least, 
bbswitch: that is how I call them). It's preferred over manually hacking with
bbswitch: the acpi_call module because it can detect the correct handle
bbswitch: preceding _DSM and has some built-in safeguards.
