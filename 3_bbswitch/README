bbswitch is a kernel module which automatically detects the required
ACPI calls for two kinds of Optimus laptops. It has been verified to
work with "real" Optimus and "legacy" Optimus laptops (at least, 
that is how I call them). It's preferred over manually hacking with
the acpi_call module because it can detect the correct handle
preceding _DSM and has some built-in safeguards.

You can build the bbswitch module for a different kernel:
  KERNEL=3.0.0 ./bbswitch.SlackBuild

You can build the bbswitch module with a different build path:
  KERNELPATH=/lib/modules/3.0.0/build ./bbswitch.SlackBuild
